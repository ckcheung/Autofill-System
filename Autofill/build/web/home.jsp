                    This project aims at developing a web platform to assist users filling in PDF forms. Users can first insert their personal information in the system. Users can then upload their own PDF form or select an existing form for filling in. The web application will use the information pre-entered to fill in the form selected by the user. In order to provide high accuracy matching, an approach for implementing schema matching function using machine learning technology will also be included in this project.
